## PART 1: STATISTICAL TOOLS


During this project of the subject _**Advanced Regression and Rrediction**_, the different methods and techniques learned in class will be used to a real dataset.

In this case, a database on the situation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Valencian community has been selected. The data has been obtained from the repository [montera34/escovid19data](https://github.com/montera34/escovid19data),
in particular of [covid_data_by_provinces](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qxbKnU39yn6yYcNkBqQ0mKnIXmKfPQ4lgpNglpJ9frE/edit#gid=0). Likewise, information on the origin of the data and the data itself can be found at [wiki_escovid19data](https://github.com/montera34/escovid19data/wiki#comunidad-valenciana)
Mention that I would like to thank [montera34](https://github.com/montera34) for the incredible work done with the COVID-19 data in Spain.

Regarding the project carried out as such, we can divide it into the following topics, which are discussed and analyzed in the development of the study.

* Advanced Estimation for Least-Squares
* Extending Linear Models
  * Feature Engineering: transformations
  * Non-linear regression
  * Robustness
* Statistical Learning Tools
  * Model Selection
  * Regularization Methods
  * Dimension reduction
  * Feature selection

It is worth mentioning that, in this case, **the objective of the project** will be to predict new cases of COVID-19 for one week per province of the Valencian community (Valencia, Castellon and Alicante) and to visualize the predictions of the best model selected regarding the cases of the first wave.
